# Research Next Steps: Scaling to Publication-Quality Study

## üéØ Strategic Research Directions

### Option A: Deep Learning Enhancement 
**Title**: *"When Do Transformers Beat Traditional Methods for Time Series?"*

**Focus**: Advanced neural architectures and scaling laws

- Pretraining experiments on large time series corpus
- Parameter scaling effects (1K ‚Üí 1M ‚Üí 10M parameters)

**Research Questions**:
- Does model scale improve time series forecasting performance?

- External features (weather, holidays, economic indicators)
- Computational constraints (training time, inference speed, memory)
- Deployment considerations (interpretability, robustness, monitoring)

**Research Questions**:
- What's the ROI of complex models vs simple baselines?
- How do models perform with missing data, outliers, concept drift?
- Which approaches work best for different business contexts?
- How do computational costs compare in production settings?

### Option C: Theoretical Understanding
**Title**: *"Pattern Complexity vs Model Complexity in Time Series Forecasting"*

**Focus**: Fundamental principles and theoretical insights

- Interpretability studies of learned representations

**Research Questions**:
- Is there a "complexity sweet spot" for time series models?
- Can we predict which model will work best for a given series?
- How much data do transformers need to outperform traditional methods?
- What theoretical principles govern time series model selection?
