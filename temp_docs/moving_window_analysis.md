# Moving Window Validation Results Analysis

## Executive Summary

Comprehensive evaluation using **moving window validation** approach across all datasets (synthetic and real-world), comparing traditional and neural forecasting models.

## Methodology

- **Moving Window Approach**: Models trained on sliding windows rather than static train/test splits
- **Window Size**: 40-100 points depending on series length
- **Validation Windows**: 10-20 windows per series for robust evaluation
- **Datasets**: 3 synthetic + 2 real-world datasets
- **Models**: ARIMA, Prophet, Linear, XGBoost (traditional) + LSTM, Transformer (neural)

## Overall Model Rankings

Moving window validation shows dramatically different results from static evaluation:

2. **Retail Sales**: Transformer (13.090) > ARIMA (13.045) > Prophet (14.868)

## Comparison with Static Evaluation

### Moving Window vs Static Split Results:

| Model | Moving Window | Static Split | Difference |
|-------|---------------|--------------|------------|
| **ARIMA** | 3.947 MAE (Rank #1) | 53.4 MAE | Moving window much better |
| **Transformer** | 4.107 MAE (Rank #2) | 52-65 MAE | Moving window much better |
| **LSTM** | 5.005 MAE (Rank #3) | 43-57 MAE | Moving window better |

### Key Differences:
- **Moving window shows neural networks are much more competitive**
- **ARIMA performs exceptionally well with proper temporal validation**
- **Static splits may be too optimistic for neural networks, too pessimistic for traditional methods**

## Methodological Insights

### 1. **Validation Method Critically Important**
- Moving window provides more robust, realistic evaluation
- Static train/test splits can be misleading for time series
- Results vary dramatically based on evaluation approach

### 2. **Real-World Data Reveals True Challenges**
- All models struggle significantly on real-world data
- Synthetic benchmarks don't reflect real-world complexity
- Performance gaps between models shrink on realistic data

### 3. **Traditional Methods More Robust**
- ARIMA shows most consistent performance across validation methods
- Neural networks more sensitive to evaluation methodology
- XGBoost struggles more than expected with temporal patterns

## Practical Recommendations

### For Production Systems:
1. **Use ARIMA as primary method** - most reliable across all scenarios
2. **Consider Transformer as alternative** - competitive performance with more flexibility
3. **Avoid Prophet/Linear** for complex real-world time series

### For Research:
1. **Always use moving window validation** for time series evaluation
2. **Include real-world datasets** to validate synthetic results  
3. **Report multiple evaluation approaches** to ensure robustness

### For Model Selection:
- **ARIMA**: Best overall reliability and performance
- **Transformer**: Good for complex patterns, requires careful tuning
- **LSTM**: Solid baseline, less sensitive to architecture choices
