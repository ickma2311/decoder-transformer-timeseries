## 📋 Abstract

Time series forecasting has seen significant advances with transformer architectures, yet most approaches adopt encoder-only designs with bidirectional attention that can inadvertently access future information during training. This paper introduces a decoder-only transformer architecture with causal attention for time series forecasting and provides a comprehensive empirical comparison against traditional statistical methods and existing neural approaches.

**Key Findings:**
- 🥇 **Decoder-only transformers achieve 2.143 MAE** (12.7% better than encoder-only)
- 📉 **36% improvement** over traditional methods
- ⚡ **76% fewer parameters** (136K vs 565K) than standard transformers
- 🎯 **Parameter efficiency matters more than model size** for time series

## 🔬 Methodology

### Models Evaluated

**Traditional Methods (60 series each):**
- ARIMA with automatic order selection
- Prophet with trend/seasonality decomposition  
- XGBoost with engineered temporal features
- Linear baseline

**Neural Methods (15 series each):**
- **Decoder-Only Transformer** (136K params) - **🥇 Best Overall**
- Standard Transformer (565K params, encoder-only)
- Large Transformer (4.85M params, encoder-only)
- LSTM baseline (51K params)

### Datasets

- **Monash TSF via Hugging Face**: `tourism`, `traffic`, `electricity`, `weather`
- **ETT (Energy)**: `ETTh1` via Hugging Face

We preprocess up to 20 series per dataset for faster iteration. See `data/dataset_summary.csv` after running the preparation script for exact counts.
